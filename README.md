In this final qualifying work, the problem of analyzing network traffic using machine learning was considered, during which the relevance of the problem was analyzed, functional models of the IDEF0 and IDEF3 design procedures were created, and the goals and objectives of the work were formulated. Also, the paper studies methods for analyzing network traffic and machine learning algorithms, considers machine learning algorithms for analyzing network traffic. The substantive and mathematical formulation of the problem was described. As part of the development of information support, a conceptual, logical model of the database was created, an analysis of functional requirements was carried out and a program interface was developed. At the end of the work, a program was developed for analyzing network traffic using machine learning.
